# a. Introduction

In this evidence I am going to analyze the data set "*Ev 2_data*" which
is about economic factors that could affect or impact the amount of
credit that is granted for households

First of all: \| \| **¿What is time series analysis?**

Time series analysis is a way of analyzing a sequence of data points
collected over an interval of time. Analyst record data points at
consistent intervals over a set period of time rather than just
recording the data points intermittently or randomly. This analysis can
show how variables change over time, because it shows how the data
adjusts over the course of data points and it provides additional source
of information with a set order of dependencies between the data.

This analysis typically requiered the use of large number of data points
to ensure consistency and reliability. This ensures that any trend or
pattern discovered are not outliers and can account for seasonal
variance. Also this analyisis can be used for forecasting and predicting
future based on the historical data analyzed *(Time Series Analysis:
Definition, Types, Techniques, and When It's Used.S.F)*.

# b. Background

-   **What are the latest trends of credit to households in Mexico?
    Please cite at least 1 external reference to develop your
    explanation.**

According to Statista in a study of **Mexico: change on housing demand
2019-2020**

![](images/statistic_id1150753_mexico_-change-on-housing-demand-2019-2020%20(1).png){width="397"}

In 2020 It was estimated that the demand for houses would decrease by
nine percent in Mexico in comparison to the previous year(2019).
Households with improved **credit** status were expected to suffer the
most, with an estimated reduction of **14.1 percent (**Bases de Datos
Biblioteca TEC, s. f**.)**

reference: *Bases de Datos Biblioteca TEC*. (s. f.). Recuperado 10 de
septiembre de 2022, de
<https://biblioteca-ils.tec.mx:443/wamvalidate?url=https%3A%2F%2F0-www-statista-com.biblioteca-ils.tec.mx%3A443%2Fstatistics%2F1150753%2Fmexico-change-housing-demand%2F>

Also According to CEIC DATA

-Mexico Credit to Households was reported at 209.013 USD bn in Dec 2021
and this records an increase from the previous number of 205.764 USD bn
for Sep 2021(CEICdata.com, 2018).

With this information we can observe that the trend is actually growing.
Besides the investigation made before, the pandemic of Covid could
affect this trend but overall the trend seems to be increasing.
According to this website the data reached an all-time high of **209.013
USD bn** in Dec 2021 and a record low of **30.915 USD bn** in Mar
1995(CEICdata.com, 2018).

# c. Description of the Problem Situation

-   **What is the problem situation?**

Financiera Ma is a popular financial intermediary present in Latin
American countries. In Mexico the use of credit cards are considerably
low. Financiera MA don´t understand why their clients don´t use their
credit cards as often as expected. Maya Velazquez the Chief credit
officer will be developing a clear understanding of how Socio-economic
characteristics of Mexico influence individual decisions whether to
purchase with credit cards or not. In this case is about economic
factors that could affect or impact the amount of credit that is granted
for households

-   **How to address the problem situation?**

My job in this evidence 2 is to develop time series models (ARMA, ARIMA
or SARIMA AND VAR) that can help understand the essential economic
factors that affect/or impact the amount of credit for households, also
a forecast to estimate the amount of the 5 next periods.

# d. Data and Methodology

-   **Describe the dataset's variables**

```{r,include=FALSE}
str(datacredit)
```

The data set has **7** columns and **109** observations. It is important
to mention that the data set counts with Na's and is not normalized.

In this case I decided to do two subsets on the data. In part A, only
using **Date** and **Credit to households**, the name of the data frame
is **data_credit,** while in PART B using the data normalized without
NA's since **01/01/2005**, the name of the data frame is **ev2_datam.**

The Date is in POSIXCT format, while all the other variables are in
numeric format, specifically type dbl.

**Variable Description**

1.  **date period of time** : quarterly basis.

2.  **credit_to_households** :Total credit to households and non-profit
    institutions serving households, unadjusted for breaks. Billions of
    Mexican Pesos, Not Seasonally Adjusted. Source: Federal Reserve Bank
    of St. Louis.

3.  **inflation_rate:** Rate at which prices for goods and services rise
    over a time period.

4.  **gdp_growth GDP** : measures the value of final goods and services
    produced in the U.S. GDP growth rate.

5.  **unemployment** : Percentage of the total labor force that is
    unemployed.

6.  **consumer_confidence** : Referencia a la situación económica actual
    y esperada del hogar del entrevistado.

7.  **remittances :**Money or goods that migrants send back to families
    and friends in origin countries (Migration Data Portal). Millions of
    Dollars.

-   Plot the variable credit_to_households using a time series format

```{r}

plot(datacredit$date,datacredit$credit_to_households, type="l",col="lightpink1", lwd=2, xlab ="Date",ylab ="Total Credit to households ", main = "Quarterly Credit to households")

```

The first observation is that although there's fluctuation in the data
over time, the general trend seems to be increasing . This means that
the credit to households has been generally increasing since 2000.

## i) Decompose the time series data into trend, seasonal, and random components. Briefly,

**Describe the decomposition time series plot. Do the time series data
show a trend? Do the time series data show seasonality?**

```{r}
ev2_ts<-ts(datacredit$credit_to_households,start=c(2005,1),end=c(2021,4),frequency=4)
           #frequency=4,start=c(2005,1))
ev2_tsd <-decompose(ev2_ts)
plot(ev2_tsd)
```

The time series data shows a trend and the trend is overall increasing.

Also it shows seasonallity and approximately the peak in
credit_to_households occurs every year at Q3 Mentioning the decrease,
approximately it occurs every year at Q1 with oscillating fluctuations
in between.

## ii)Detect the presence of stationary

```{r}
adf.test(datacredit$credit_to_households)
```

| P-Value \> 0.05. Fail to reject the H0. The time series data is non-stationary meaning that is not constant over time.

## iii)Detect the presence of serial autocorrelation

```{r}
acf(datacredit$credit_to_households,main="Significant Autocorrelations")
```

In this case because the data is non-stationary generally it shows the
presence of serial autocorrelation.

\
- **Does credit_to_household require a seasonal adjustment? If yes,
please display the seasonal adjustment in a time series plot.**

```{r}

seasonal_adjustment = ev2_ts - ev2_tsd$seasonal

plot(seasonal_adjustment,type="l",col="lightpink1",lwd=2,main="Quarterly Credit to households")


par(mfrow=c(1,2))

plot(datacredit$date,datacredit$credit_to_households, type="l",col="lightpink2", lwd=2, xlab ="date",ylab ="Credit to households", main = "Quarterly Credit to households")

plot(seasonal_adjustment,type="l",col="lightpink2",lwd=2,main="Seasonal Adjustment")

```

In this case we do need a seasonal adjustment and with this seasonal
adjustment, we can smooth out the anomalies in this time series. What we
are doing to the original series is to substract the seasonal component
and reducing or deleting the impact of the seasonal factor.

# e. Time Series Regression Analysis

## a. Time Series Model 1

-   Estimate 3 different time series regression models. You might want
    to consider ARMA (p,q), ARIMA (p,d,q), and / or SARIMA (p,d,q)
    (P,D,Q)m.\

    -   **ARIMA** short for Autoregressive integrated moving average.

    -   **SARIMA** short for "Seasonal autoregresive integrated moving
        average", an extension of the model we know as ARIMA.

### ARIMA 1

```{r}

ARIMA.ev1<-Arima(datacredit$credit_to_households,order=c(1,1,1))
print(ARIMA.ev1)
```

### SARIMA 2

```{r}

SARIMA.1<-Arima(datacredit$credit_to_households,order=c(1,3,1),seasonal=list(order=c(1,3,1), period=4))
print(SARIMA.1)

```

### SARIMA 3

```{r}
SARIMA.ev3<-Arima(datacredit$credit_to_households,order=c(1,1,1),seasonal=list(order=c(1,1,1), period=4))
print(SARIMA.ev3)
```

-   **Based on diagnostic tests, compare the 3 estimated time series
    regression models and select the results that you consider might
    generate the best forecast.**\

```{r}

plot(ARIMA.ev1$residuals,main="ARIMA(1,1,1)")
plot(SARIMA.1$residuals,main="SRIMA(1,3,1)")
plot(SARIMA.ev3$residuals,main="SARIMA(1,1,1)")

```

With this graphs we can observe how the residuals behaviour is within
the three models. The mean and the variance in the three models are
having a more constant behaviour and with this we can do a more accurate
forecast.

```{r, warning=FALSE}

#ADF test suggest that ARIMA residuals are stationary since p-value is <   0.05. 
adf.test(ARIMA.ev1$residuals)

#ADF test suggest that SARIMA residuals are stationary since p-value is < 0.05. 

adf.test(SARIMA.1$residuals)


#ADF test suggest that SARIMA residuals are stationary since p-value is < 0.05. 
adf.test(SARIMA.ev3$residuals)

```

In this case all the models are stationary

```{r}
# ACF plot displays weak or no autocorrelation. 
acf(ARIMA.ev1$residuals,main="ACF - ARIMA (1,1,1)")    


# ACF plot displays weak or no autocorrelation. 
acf(SARIMA.1$residuals,main="ACF - SARIMA (1,3,1)")        


 # ACF plot displays weak or no autocorrelation. 
acf(SARIMA.ev3$residuals,main="ACF - SARIMA (1,1,1)")   
```

The models #2 and #3 show weak to no autocorrelation While model #1 show
a little autocorrelation.

```{r}
# P-value is > 0.05 indicating that ARiMA model does not show residual serial autocorrelation. 
Box.test(ARIMA.ev1$residuals,lag=1,type="Ljung-Box")

# P-value is > 0.05 indicating that ARIMA model does not show  # residual serial autocorrelation. 
Box.test(SARIMA.1$residuals,lag=1,type="Ljung-Box")      

# P-value is > 0.05 indicating that ARIMA model does not show  # residual serial autocorrelation. 
Box.test(SARIMA.ev3$residuals,lag=1,type="Ljung-Box")        
```

All of the three models do not show residual serial autocorrelation.

### b).Selected model

After analyzing and comparing all the models, the chosen model will be
the SARIMA (1,1,1), after doing all the necessary tests to the three
models, all of them are stationary and do not have serial
autocorrelation, so basing on the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) the
lowest from the three models is the SARIMA model 3 with 988.55 .

-   **By using the selected model, make a forecast for the next 5
    periods. In doing so, include a time series plot showing your
    forecast**.

```{r}
#SELECTED TIME SERIES MODEL

SARIMA.3.forecast<-forecast(SARIMA.ev3,h=5)
plot(SARIMA.3.forecast)
autoplot(SARIMA.3.forecast)
SARIMA.3.forecast
```

With this forecast table the **point forecast** is our best guess of
what we can happen in the next 5 periods, but to have more sense of how
far off this forecast could be the lower or higher 95% intervals, show
that there's an 95% chance that the data will fall in this interval.

We can observe with this forecast that the time series credit to
households will be increasing

## b. Time Series Model 2

In order to use the data set correctly I am going to use only the dates
since 01/01/2005.

                                        credit_to_households,
                                        inflation_rate,
                                        gdp_growth,
                                        unemployment,

```

-   **From the time series data set, select the explanatory variables
    that might affect the total credit to households in Mexico**

1.  **inflation_rate:** Rate at which prices for goods and services rise
    over a time period.

2.  **gdp_growth GDP** : measures the value of final goods and services
    produced in the U.S. GDP growth rate.

3.  **unemployment** : Percentage of the total labor force that is
    unemployed.

-   **Describe the hypothetical relationship / impact between each
    selected factor and the dependent variable credit_to_household. For
    example, how does the unemployment rate increase / reduce the credit
    to households in Mexico?**

    -   Hypothesis:

    -   Unemployment rate may reduce the credit to household's in
        Mexico. GDP Growth may increase the credit to household's in
        Mexico. Inflation rate may reduce the credit to household's in
        Mexico.

-   **In describing the above relationships, please include a time
    series plot that displays the selected variables' performance over
    the time period.**

```{r}
### converting to time series format

e2ts<-ts(ev2_datam$credit_to_households,start=c(2005,1),end=c(2021,4),frequency=4)
inf_rate<- ts(ev2_datam$inflation_rate,start=c(2005,1),end=c(2021,4),frequency=4)
gdp_gr<- ts(ev2_datam$gdp_growth,start=c(2005,1),end=c(2021,4),frequency=4)
unem <- ts(ev2_datam$unemployment,start=c(2005,1),end=c(2021,4),frequency=4)

```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,3))
plot(e2ts,type="l",col="lightpink4",lwd=2,main="Credit to Households")
plot(inf_rate,type="l",col="lightpink3",lwd=2,main="Inflation Rate")
plot(gdp_gr,type="l",col="lightpink2",lwd=2,main="GDP Growth")
plot(unemp,type="l",col="lightpink1",lwd=2,main="Unemployment")
```

```{r}
 ggplot(ev2_datam, aes(x=credit_to_households, y=inflation_rate)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)
 
  ggplot(ev2_datam, aes(x=credit_to_households, y=unemployment)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)
  
   ggplot(ev2_datam, aes(x=credit_to_households, y=gdp_growth)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)

```

As we can observe the relationship/Impact with credit to households and
inflation rate is weak to non correlated, but shows a little positive
relationship, with unemployment is negative, with gdp growth shows a
little to non correlated negative relationship.

-   Estimate a VAR_Model that includes at least 1 explanatory factor
    that might affect each of the selected stocks prices.

**Basing the explanatory factors in the visualizations made before**

1.  ***I choose to do 1 VAR model with unemployment, inflation rate and
    gdp growth.***

### VAR 1

```{r}
VARR_ts<-cbind(e2ts, unem, inf_rate ,gdp_gr)
colnames(VARR_ts)<-cbind("credit_to_households","unemployment", "inflation_rate", "gpd_growth")

#VARR_ts

#Check what is the ideal lag
lag_selection<-VARselect(VARR_ts,lag.max=5,type="const", season=4)
lag_selection$selection
lag_selection$criteria

```

```{r}
VARMODEL1<-VAR(VARR_ts,p=5,type="const",season=4)
summary(VARMODEL1)
```

In this case for Credit house hold we have **3 statistically significant
variables** which are:

1.  The lag of one period of credit households (credit.l1)positive
    impact

2.  The lag of three periods of credit households (credit.l3)negative
    impact

| Lower significance (.) is:

3.  The lag of one period of unemployment (unemployment.l5) negative
    impact

-   **Detect if the estimated VAR_Models residuals are stationary.**\

```{r, warning=FALSE}
VARMODEL1_residuals<-data.frame(residuals(VARMODEL1))
adf.test(VARMODEL1_residuals$credit_to_households)

Box.test(VARMODEL1_residuals$credit_to_households,lag=1,type="Ljung-Box") 

```

| The P-Value \< 0.05. We reject the H0. The time series data is stationary meaning that is constant over time.
| P-value is \> 0.05 indicating the model do not show residual serial autocorrelation.

-   **Detect if the estimated VAR_Models residuals show serial
    autocorrelation**.

```{r}
acf(VARMODEL1_residuals$credit_to_households,main="VAR 1 - Credit To Households") 
```

The model DO NOT show residual serial autocorrelation.

## c.Model selection

-   **Based on the regression results and diagnostic tests, select the
    VAR_Model that you consider might generate the best forecast.**

    -   The model made before named "VARMODEL1" with the variables
        unemployment, inflation rate and gdp growth ,I consider might
        generate the best forecast, based on model diagnosis the model
        is stationary and doesn't show residual autocorrelation.

-   **Briefly interpret the regression results. That is, is there a
    statistically significant relationship between the explanatory
    variables and the main dependent variable?**

    -   There is a statistically significant relationship between 3
        variables but in general the lag of one period of unemployment
        has a negative impact with the dependent variable, as well as
        the lag of one and three periods of credit to households.

-   **Is there an instantaneous causality between credit_to_household
    and the selected explanatory variables? Estimate a Granger Causality
    Test to either reject or fail to reject the hypothesis of
    instantaneous causality.**

    -   The p-value is **lower** than 0.05 so we can reject the Null
        hypothesis.

        meaning that Credit to house holds can cause and explain

        the independent variables in an unidirectional way.

    -   Talking about the instantaneous causality there is NOT a
        bidirectional

        causality, the p-value is **greater** than 0.05, in this case
        the credit to

        household does NOT impact on the independent variables mentioned
        before.

```{r}
grangermodel<-causality(VARMODEL1,cause="credit_to_households")
grangermodel

```

-   Based on the selected VAR_Model, forecast the total credit to
    households in Mexico for the next 5 periods. Display the forecast in
    a time series plot.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
forecast_1<-predict(VARMODEL1,n.ahead=5,ci=0.95) ### forecast for the next 5 months

```

1.  **January Q1 2022**: It was expected a reach of 4390.851 but to have
    more sense of how far off this forecast could be the lower or higher
    results show a decrease up to 4330.645 or an increase up to
    4451.057.

2.  **APRIL Q2 2022:** It was expected a reach of 4412.207 but to have
    more sense of how far off this forecast could be the lower or higher
    results show a decrease up to 4310.642 or an increase up to 4513.771

3.  **AUGUST Q3 2022:** It was expected a reach of 4486.205 but to have
    more sense of how far off this forecast could be the lower or higher
    results show a decrease up to 4336.366 or an increase up to 4636.044

4.  **DECEMBER Q4 2022**: It was expected a reach of 4552.319 but to
    have more sense of how far off this forecast could be the lower or
    higher results show a decrease up to 4332.29 or an increase up to
    4712.340

5.  **JANUARY Q1 2023** :It was expected a reach of 4570.974 but to have
    more sense of how far off this forecast could be the lower or higher
    results show a decrease up to 4338.690 or an increase up to 4803.259

    As we can observe the trend shows an overall increase.

# f. Conclusions and Recommendations

-   **Briefly describe the main insights from previous sections.**

    -   The selected model in part a) based on de diagnosis results and
        AIC test, was the SARIMA (1,1,1) and according to this model,
        the forecast predictions the time series credit to households
        will be increasing for the next 5 periods.

    -   In part b) The insights for the VAR model is that there is a
        statistically significant relationship between 3 variables, but
        in general the lag of one period of unemployment has a negative
        impact with the dependent variable, as well as the lag of one
        and three periods of credit to households.

    -   Basing on the Granger Causality Credit to house holds can cause
        and explain the independent variables in an unidirectional way.

    -   To conclude the VAR forecast also showed an overall increase in
        the trend for the next 5 periods.

-   **Based on the selected results, please share at least 1
    recommendation that address the problem situation.**

    -   According to the insights, I recommend **Financiera MA** to take
        into account external economic factors because they can affect
        directly the credit that is granted for households. In this case
        Unemployment is a factor that affects directly the MODEL and has
        a negative impact on the credit. But overall the trend on Credit
        Households is increasing besides previous factors as the
        Pandemic or other external aspects.
    -   In the Evidence 1, I recommended **Financiera MA** to create a
        more personalized experience based on the generation of their
        clients and also offering some type of credit rewards. In
        addition to that recommendation **Financiera MA** could offer
        low credit rates. This could be related in creating an easy
        credit for people that aren´t that connected to finance.
    -   Figure1.In 2021 people between the ages of 18 and 70 had at
        least one formal loan, a figure that is equivalent to 32.7% of
        the population in this age range (INEGI,2022)
    -   Figure1.

-   In conlclusion this recommendations could be more attractive for
    clients, because many people in Mexico don´t know how to handle
    their money/finance. Also to attract more people and retain their
    actual clients **Financiera Ma** could offer some financial advice
    to their interested clients and actual clients.
